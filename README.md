## Description

The purpose of this project was to allow a user input on the command-line that generates a professionally styled README for a new project. The user is prompted with 9 in-depth questions that gather enough information to complete the README template. Within the template a table of contents provides fast navigation to the different dynamically created sections. Along with details like description, installation and usage the application also provides the license badge and links to the user's email and GitHub profile. For additional details see the gif below.
